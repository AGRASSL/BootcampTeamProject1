# Foodie Fridge

## This Program

Foodie Fridge is a web based application that utilizes one of the most respected server-side, food-focused APIs to generate recipes based on ingredients that users have on-hand. This application prompts users to enter 3 ingredients and any dietary restrictions before producing 9 recipes that meet the user's specifications. All results feature a large picture of the recipe, a detailed title, the receipe source, and a link directly to the recipe. In addition to the generated recipes, Foodie Fridge also provides the user with a custom tailered wine pairing to compliment the ingredients incorporated in their meal.
